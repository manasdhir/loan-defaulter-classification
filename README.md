We are going to build a model that predicts if someone who seeks a loan might be a defaulter or a non-defaulter. We have several independent variables like, checking account balance, credit history, purpose, loan amount etc.
I have used decision trees to build this model, it uses gini impurity to build the tree which means that the gini impurity reduces for every branch of the decision tree.
First i have performed EDA on the data to label encode it and to make it fit for building decision tree model.
I have shown the accuracy of the model both with and without regularization.When the model is trained without regularization it tends to overfit on training data and performs poorly on the testing data.The importance of each variable or column being used for prediction is also shown along with a confusion matrix which visualizes the accuracy of the regularized model.
